        <h2>Active </h2>

        <p>First & foremost, we kick this section off with my favorite: <b>soccer</b> ‚öΩ.
          I've been a player and a superfan for the past ~10 years. Played in
          Central Asia, all 4 years in high school, and now I often play futsal. The
          past 4 years, I've been refereeing soccer games in the western side of WA. Favorite team:

        <h2>Personal</h2>

        <p>I love music, and its variety. From hip-hop to R&B, classical and rock, all
          have found their way to my playlists. And my favorite instrument? <b>Piano:</b>

        <p><b>Travel</b> has not only been an interest, but also a necessity as my family
          and I moved to the US back in 2014. A lot of our family is scattered along the globe,
          and many of speak different <b>languages</b>. Being born in Turkmenistan, I am native in
          English and Russian and proficient in Turkmen and Ukrainian. My favorite vacation place
          so far? Puerto Vallarta:

        <h2>Academic</h2><p>
          I have graduated from the 2-year <b>STARS</b> program at the University of
          Washington, being a part of a diverse cohort of students. The program is
          dedicated to helping students from underserved backgrounds become better
          engineers and Computer Scientists through a variety
          of workshops, courses, and other resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Mythology:</b> After discovering Greek and Norse Mythologies, I found the
          stories to be very interesting and often providing insight into the lives
          and values of people at the time. Learning Mythology was something that
          I became interested in after numerous movies, shows, and games, many of which
          were inspired by the Mythology.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Philosophy and History:</b> Plato's theory of forms, Socratic method,
          Scandinavia and Vikings, Ancient Greece, and my personal favorite, Ancient
          Rome with all its richness of history, have been the topics of my fascination
          for quite some time, and all of which served as inspiration for many of my
          creative endeavors.

        <h2>Professional</h2>

        <p>
          Along with my main professional interest for <b>Software Development</b>, I am fascinated
          by <b>Web3</b> and <b>Game Development</b>. As someone who has gone through countless number
          of game titles, developing games has been one of the best ways to get creative.
          I developed games for mobile, desktop, and Virtual Reality.
        </p>

        <p>
          With what I view as a
          <b>Metaverse Renaissance</b>, Virtual and Mixed Realities will be the key to innovation.
          And gaming, will only keep on growing and expanding into new markets. And with
          this being a passion of mine, I will bring my creativity by contributing to the
          creation of the Metaverse.
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to development process, I try to keep myself versatile and learn
          a variety of skills, switching between <b>Front End, Back End, and Full Stack
          development.</b> And as you can see, my recent learning has been focused mostly on frontend as I am
          developing this website. <b>Design</b> is has been an interest of mine for quite some time,
          and I enjoy planning out the designs for my projects, selecting the right tools, colors,
          interactivity, accesibility, and storytelling.
        </p>

        <p>When it comes to the specific tools and languages I use the most, the list
          includes <b>C#, Java, Javascript, React, HTML/CSS, SQL </b>, and tools such as
          <b>Unity, Figma and Blender</b> to mention some.
