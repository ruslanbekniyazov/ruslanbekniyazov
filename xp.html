      <p>You entered the <b>XP Zone</b>, this is where you will see my past quests.
        I have been putting a lot of XP points into agility, as I am a practitioner
        of <b>Agile Lyfestyle</b>. Throughout the week, I collect feedback and information, find
        ways to further my progress, plan and set goals, and triple down on my interests.
        Helps prioritize things in my the backlog I refine daily.
        </p>
        <p> At the end of the week, I take a look at what I have achieved, and then look for ways to
          improve next week. Medium-term and long-term goals share a similar approach, which has
          been working great to keep myself accountable. This website is yet another medium-term
          task pulled from the top of the backlog. P.S. feedback is appreciated!</p>

            <blockquote><p id="quote">Speccing into Agility has shown to create imbalance
              in the current meta. Might get nerfed in the next patch, an OP strat right now.

        <h2>Microsoft Explore </h2>

        <p>If I was to rank experiences that contributed the most significant to my learning, my
          first internship at Microsoft woudl place very high. It was my first exposure to
          the industry, and I am glad to say that it has been very smooth, thanks to the great
          culture and thanks to the team that I was a part of. Looking back, it surprises me how
          much I was able to learn and accomplish in 12 weeks.

        <p>Our team of 3 was tasked with developing a gamified full-stack
          training solution aimed to test the security knowledge of Microsoft employees.
          We were able to accomplish that using ASP.NET (utilizing MVC design pattern),
          Unity Engine, WebGL, Azure. We implemented the training solution with a theme and design
          that we stuck to, added a storyline to make the game more interesting, and implemented
          leaderboards to track employee progress and incentivize learning. </p>

          <p>During the internship, I experienced both the Product Management and
            Software Engineering disciplines, gaining the skills that I used and will
            definitely continue using as I move forward.

        <h2>Microsoft SWE Internship </h2>

        <p> After Explore internship, I came back to Microsoft as a SWE intern on Yammer's
          Compliance and Search team (this is my current experience). Again,
          I beat my expectations for the amount of knowledge that I would gain. And this time,
          I am interning on campus, so I was able to meet and become friends with
          lots of new people in-person!

        </div>

          <p>So far, I was able to truly understand many Computer Science principles through
            hands-on experience. Test-driven approach and the proper ways of testing an application,
            Event-driven programming, archiving, streaming, containerization using Docker and
            Kubernetes, REST. The skills that I gained and continue to gain from this internship
            made me a better engineer and thinker, both of which I value greatly.

        <h2>iD Tech</h2>

        <p>Having taught myself a lot of the skills I currently possess, I wanted to support
          the young Computer Scientists by guiding and teaching them the skills that have been
          so invaluable to my software and game development processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          At iD Tech, I had a great time teaching game development, and what
          is very important, I was able to learn a ton. Not only by improving the topic
          presentation and communication skills, but also by brushing up and learning new
          things about the concepts that I was teaching, since a lot of planning and additional
          topic research went into each lesson.

        <h2><a id="undecoratedColorlessLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.startup-uw.com/">StartupUW</a></h2>

        <p>Seattle is a hub to a huge amount of talent, and I believe that University of
          Washington should become a center of innovation and startups in the U.S. That is why
          I joined StartupUW, the biggest entrepreneurship club at UW. Together, starting with
          a small team of about 8 people, we were able to reorganize the club and split it
          into intiatives, and me, I was in charge of Startup-a-thon.
        </p>

        <div class="imageContainer">

        </div>

        <p>
          Startup-a-thon was an early-stage startup competion, and with hours of work being
          put into development, planning, and marketing, we were able to host a grandiose
          event with over 100 participants. From renowned speakers to useful startup
          workshops, this event was a success.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>Becoming more and more indulged in the operations of the club, I became
          the Executive VP of the  club. With the success of Startup-a-thon, we were
          able to expand the team to almost double the size, after which I progressed
          to the position of  a Co-President. With dedicaiton, we are striving towards
          making StartupUW the central node for student startups that start at UW Seattle.

        <p>I hope this provided you with an insight to my
          current build. To keep my pages short, I try to stick to my personal
          rule of 4: 4 main pages on this website, 4 slides on the main page, 4 social
          links, 4 seasons, 4 phases of the moon, 4 states of matter.
          4 is an amazing number, isn't it? </p>
