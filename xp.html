          <h2>2022 - Amazon SDE Internship </h2>
  
          <p>
            At Amazon, I worked on the Alexa AI team, improving Alexa's Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
            In 3 months, I worked on a variety of highly impactful projects: I began with designing a system to cut trainset 
            generation time by 80%, hugely improving efficiency of Alexaâ€™s training stage. Then, I proceeded to work on reducing
            regression triage time for data scientists via implementing a new caching system and revamping the way data was stored
            for the results of regression tests. This helped data scientists reduce the triage time from 1 day down to mere minutes.

        <h2><a id="undecoratedColorlessLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.startup-uw.com/">2022 - StartupUW</a></h2>

        <p>Seattle is a hub to a huge amount of talent, and I believe that University of
          Washington is well-poised to become one of the centers of innovation and startups in the U.S. That is why
          I joined StartupUW, the biggest entrepreneurship club at UW. Together with
          a small team of 8, we restructured the club into intiatives. At first, I was in charge of Startup-a-thon.
        </p>

        <div class="imageContainer">
          <img class="image" src="src/images/Me/startupathon4.jpg">
        </div>

        <p>
          Startup-a-thon was an early-stage startup competition. With hours of work being
          put into development, planning, and marketing, we hosted a grandiose
          event with 100+ participants. From renowned speakers, VCs, to engaging events and startup
          workshops, this event was a success.
        </p>

        <div class="imageContainer">
          <img class="image" src="src/images/Me/startupathon5.JPG">
        </div>

        <p>Soon after, I became the Executive VP of the club. Success of Startup-a-thon allowed us to
          double the size of the team. Further growth of the club propelled me to the position of Co-President.
          We strived towards making StartupUW the central node entreprenurship at UW Seattle, and during our tenure,
          we were able to do more than that: we created a community of like-minded entrepreneurs, and empowered them
          to achieve their entrepreneurial goals.

        <p>Microsoft Explore was my first exposure to the industry, one that went very well thanks to the great
          culture, and the team that I was a part of. I got to work with truly outstanding engineers.

        <p> Our broader task was to make security training fun. So - we developed a training game. 
          The game was made using Unity + WebGL. It was a creative project,
          one that made us think not only as game devs, but also as security engineers. We had
          to parse through hundreds of security training topics - and make the game fun through
          a variety of levels, storyline, and leaderboards. Upon launching it, the feedback was overwhelmingly
          positive, and we walked away with very important experience under our belts.</p>
