          <h2>Microsoft Explore </h2>

          <p>Microsoft Explore was my first exposure to
            the industry, and a very smooth at that, thanks to the great
            culture, and the team that I was a part of. I got to learn a ton,
            and work with truly outstanding engineers.

          <p>We were tasked with developing a gamified solution to test
            the security knowledge of Microsoft employees. We accomplished this by 
            implementing a training game, hosted using ASP.NET and made with Unity + WebGL. 
            This game had many touches of creativity emitting through its unique design and theme, 
            a storyline to make it more engaging, and leaderboards to track employee progress 
            and incentivize learning. With the overwhelmingly positive feedback that we have 
            gotten upon launching it, we could definitely call it a success! </p>

          <h2>Microsoft SWE Internship </h2>

          <p> After my Explore internship, I came back to Microsoft as a SWE intern on Yammer's
            Compliance and Search team. And this time, interning on campus allowed me to meet
            & become friends with so many people!

            <p>I was able to truly get hands-on with principles used at the forefront of the industry.
              A test-driven approach was core to my project. Diving into the Microservice architecture
              at its essence, I got to learn so many tools and skills it takes tp build an enterprise
              feature end-to-end, helping me become a better engineer and problem-solver.

        <h2>Amazon SDE Internship </h2>

        <p>
          At Amazon, I worked on the Alexa AI team, improving Alexa's Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
          In 3 months, I worked on a great variety of projects that made an impact: from cache optimization
          and data handling to regression testing. I learned a lot about the ecosystem, and I got hands on experience
          with AI, Machine Learning, large language models, and gained valuable experience working with AWS.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main project of improving regression testing, optimized the workflow of
          regression testing analysis from about a day down to mere minutes. My secondary project of
          cache optimization, in full implementation was projected to more than double the efficiency of the
          existing caching systems.

        <p>Having taught myself many of the skills I use, I wanted to support
          the aspiring Computer Scientists by teaching them the skills that have been
          so valuable in my software and game development ventures. iD Tech provides online 
          lessons for kids and teens, allowing them to learn the latest and the greatest tech
          to develop skills in a an engaging way. I taught game development, and due to my 
          successes as a game development instructor, I was chosen to be amongst the first
          instructors at the company to teach Virtual Reality Development.

        <h2><a id="undecoratedColorlessLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.startup-uw.com/">StartupUW</a></h2>

        <p>Seattle is a hub to a huge amount of talent, and I believe that University of
          Washington is well-poised to become a center of innovation and startups in the U.S. That is why
          I joined StartupUW, the biggest entrepreneurship club at UW. Together, starting with
          a small team of about 8 people we were able to reorganize the club and split it into intiatives.
          And at first, I was in charge of Startup-a-thon.

        </div>

        <p>
          Startup-a-thon was an early-stage startup competion, and with hours of work being
          put into development, planning, and marketing, we were able to host a grandiose
          event with over 100 participants. From renowned speakers, to fun events and startup
          workshops, lot of advice, this event was a success.
        </p>

        <div class="imageContainer">
          <img class="image" src="src/images/Me/startupathon5.JPG">
        </div>

        <p>Becoming more and more indulged in the operations of the club, I became
          the Executive VP of the club. With the success of Startup-a-thon, we were
          able to expand the team to almost double the size, after which I progressed
          to the position of Co-President. We strived towards making StartupUW the
          central node entreprenurship at UW Seattle, and during my tenure,
          we were able to do more than just that. We created a community
          of like-minded entrepreneurs, and we helped them achieve their entrepreneurial goals.
