          <p>If I was to rank experiences that contributed the most significant to my learning, my
            first internship at Microsoft is amongst the very top. It was my first exposure to
            the industry, and a very smooth at that, thanks to the great
            culture to the team that I was a part of. Looking back, it surprises me how
            much I was able to learn and accomplish in 12 weeks.

          <p>Our team of 3 was tasked with developing a gamified full-stack
            training solution that tests the security knowledge of Microsoft employees.
            We were able to accomplish that utilizing tools like ASP.NET (MVC),
            Unity Engine, WebGL, and Azure. We implemented the training solution with a theme and design
            that we stuck to, added a storyline to make the game more interesting, and implemented
            leaderboards to track employee progress and incentivize learning. </p>
  
            <p>During the internship, I experienced both the Product Management and
              Software Engineering disciplines, gaining the skills that I will
              continue using going forward.

              Utilizing test-driven approach and comprehensive ways of testing has been core to
              anything I write. Operating and really understanding Microservice architecture
              at its core, utilizing event-driven programming, archiving, streaming,
              Docker and Kubernetes are just some of the skills that I gained
              that helped me become a better engineer and problem-solver. And overall, it was a truly fun experience.

        <h2>Amazon SDE Internship </h2>

        <p>
          At Amazon, I was on the Alexa AI team working on Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
          I was able to work on a variety of projects: regression testing, cache optimization,
          and data handling. I was able to learn a lot about the Alexa ecosystem, and I was able
          to get hands on experience with AI and Machine Learning. I gained the valuable experience
          of working with cloud services, and I was able to learn a lot about AWS.
        </p>
        <p>
          My main project, revolving around improving regression testing, optimized the workflow of
          data scientist working with Alexa AI from around a day down to mere minutes. My secondary project,
          revolving around cache optimization, in full implementation was projected to double the efficiency.

        <p>Having taught myself a lot of the skills I currently possess, I wanted to support
          the young Computer Scientists by guiding and teaching them the skills that have been
          so invaluable to my software and game development processes. I was able to do that
          through iD Tech, a company that provides online lessons for kids and teens, where they
          learn about the latest tech and develop their skills in a fun and engaging way.
          I taught game development using Unity Engine, and due to my success as game development instructor,
          I was amongst chosen to be among the first instructors at the company to teach 
          Virtual Reality Development.

        </p>

        <p>
          At iD Tech, what was very important to me is that I was able to learn a ton. Not only 
          by improving my presentation and communication skills, but also by brushing up and 
          learning new things about the concepts that I was teaching, thanks to the amounts of 
          planning and research that went into each lesson.

        <p>Seattle is a hub to a huge amount of talent, and I believe that University of
          Washington should become a center of innovation and startups in the U.S. That is why
          I joined StartupUW, the biggest entrepreneurship club at UW. Together, starting with
          a small team of about 8 people we were able to 
          reorganize the club and split it into intiatives. And in the beginning,
          I was in charge of Startup-a-thon.

        <p>
          Startup-a-thon was an early-stage startup competion, and with hours of work being
          put into development, planning, and marketing, we were able to host a grandiose
          event with over 100 participants. From renowned speakers to useful startup
          workshops, this event was a success.

        <p>Becoming more and more indulged in the operations of the club, I became
          the Executive VP of the  club. With the success of Startup-a-thon, we were
          able to expand the team to almost double the size, after which I progressed
          to the position of  a Co-President. With dedicaiton, we are striving towards
          making StartupUW the central node for student startups that start at UW Seattle.
