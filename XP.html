      <p>You entered the <b>XP Zone</b>, this is where you will see my past quests and upgrades.
        Personally, I have been putting a lot of XP points into agility, as I am a core believer
        of <b>Agile Lyfestyle</b>. Throughout the week, I collect feedback and information, trying find
        ways in which I could further my development, tripling down on my interests and things that
        are fun. </p>
        <p>Then, with the collected information I plan out my week, setting clear tasks, categorizing them
          into my main life goals, which in turn helps me prioritize things in the backlog. Following
          my plan, I check my progress every day and refine the backlog. At the end of the week, I
          take a look at what I have achieved, perhaps pat myself on the back, and then look for ways to
          improve on my next week.
        </p>
        <p>Along with short-term improvement, medium-term and long-term goals share a similar approach,
          which has been working great to keep myself accountable. This website is yet another medium-term
          task that found its way to the top of the backlog, which I now pulled. And please, feedback is
          truly appreciated.</p>

        <h2>Microsoft Explore </h2>

        <p>Amongst the experiences that I consider the most significant to my learning, my
          summer internship at Microsoft ranks very high. My first exposure to the industry has
          been a smooth experience, thanks to the great culture and the team that I was a part of.
          Looking back, it surprises me how much I was able to learn in 12 weeks, and I am looking
          forward to my Software Engineering internship in the summer of this year!
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>In those 12 weeks, our team of 3 was tasked with developing a gamified, full-stack
          training solution aimed to test the security knowledge of Microsoft employees.
          We were able to accomplish that using ASP.NET, utilizing the MVC design pattern,
          Unity engine, WebGL, Azure, and other tools throughout the development
          process. We implemented leaderboards to
          track employee progress and incentivize learning. </p>

          <p>During the internship, I expereinced both the Product Management and
            Software Engineering disciplines. I gained the skills that I will definitely use
            going forward, and I expanded my network along the way.

        <h2>iD Tech</h2>

        <p>Having taught myself a lot of the skills I currently possess, I wanted to support
          the young Computer Scientists by guiding and teaching them the skills that have been
          so invaluable to my software and game development processes.
        </p>

        <p>
          At iD Tech, I had a great time teaching game development, and what
          is very important, I was able to learn a ton. Not only by improving the topic
          presentation and communication skills, but also by brushing up and learning new
          things about the concepts that I was teaching, since a lot of planning and additional
          topic research went into each lesson.

        <h2><a id="undecoratedColorlessLink" target="_blank" href="https://www.startup-uw.com/">StartupUW</a></h2>

        <p>Seattle is a hub to a huge amount of talent, and I believe that University of
          Washington should become a center of innovation and startups in the U.S. That is why
          I joined StartupUW, the biggest entrepreneurship club at UW. Together, starting with
          a small team of about 8 people, we were able to reorganize the club and split it
          into intiatives, and me, I was in charge of Startup-a-thon.
        </p>

        <div class="imageContainer">

        </div>

        <p>
          Startup-a-thon was an early-stage startup competion, and with hours of work being
          put into development, planning, and marketing, we were able to host a grandiose
          event with over 100 participants. From renowned speakers to useful startup
          workshops, this event was a success.
        </p>

        </div>

        <p>Becoming more and more indulged in the operations of the club, I became
          the Executive VP of the  club, until later I progressed to the position of
          a Co-President. With dedicaiton, we are striving towards making StartupUW
          the central node for student startups that start at UW Seattle.

        <h2>Shhh...ðŸ¤« Wanna see something cool?</h2>

        <p>I hope this was informative and provided you with an insight to my
          current build. To keep my pages short, I try to stick to my personal
          rule of 4: 4 main pages on this website, 4 slides on the main page, 4 social
          links, 4 seasons, 4 phases of the moon, 4 states of matter (if you don't count
          Bose-Einstein condensates). 4 is an amazing number, isn't it? </p>


        <p>But allow me not to bore you, since I want this website to be a fun experience
          for its visitors (and let me know if you see how I can improve it).
