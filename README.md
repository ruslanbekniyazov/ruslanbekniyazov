# Who I am

If I have not had the pleasure to introduce myself to you, then this is the perfect opportunity to do the intro. My name is Ruslan Bekniyazov, I live in Seattle, WA, and I am a Junior at the University of Washington, majoring in Computer Science, minoring in Entrepreneurship. I was born in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, in what they call "The City of White Marble," and my family is spread all over the world. I develop anything that fascinates my mind: games, VR projects, apps, and websites. I love soccer, history (especially Roman and Greek), philosophy, investing, entrepreneurship and a bit of snowboarding and piano.
